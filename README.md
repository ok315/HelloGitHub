# Tic-Tac-Toe (Text-Based Game)

This is a simple **text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python. It allows two players to take turns and play the game on a 3x3 grid.

## Features:

- Players take turns choosing their moves.
- The game shows available moves after every turn.
- Detects when a player wins or if the game is a draw.

## How to Play:
1. The game will ask for the names of Player 1 and Player 2.
2. Players take turns entering the position for their move (like `top-L`, `mid-R`, etc.).
3. The game will continue until one player wins or the game is a draw.


## How to Run:
